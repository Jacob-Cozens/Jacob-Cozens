## CALLING ALL GAMERS

Hey, friends. My name is Jake and I am an aspiring software engineer. Being born in the year 2000, I came into this world witnessing the unfolding of the internet. As a result, I know my way around a computer, and I'm more than well versed in surfing the web. I'm an ideas guy, so I'm hoping by studying programming, I will be able to execute on some of these great ideas I have. Anyway, enjoy your stay on my profile!
